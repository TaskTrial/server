# Testing Guide

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive testing strategy with three levels of testing:

1. **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests how components work together
3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Tests complete user workflows from start to finish

## Test Documentation

The testing documentation has been split into three focused guides:

- [Unit Testing Guide](./UNIT_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [Integration Testing Guide](./INTEGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [End-to-End Testing Guide](./E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

## Running Tests

- Unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- End-to-End tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- All tests: `npm run test:all`

Please refer to the appropriate guide file for detailed instructions and best practices for each type of test.
