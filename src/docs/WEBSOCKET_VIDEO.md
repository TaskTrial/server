# WebSocket and Video Conferencing Integration

This document provides an overview of the WebSocket and Video Conferencing functionality in our application.

## WebSocket Integration

We use Socket.IO for real-time communication between the server and clients. Socket.IO enables features like:

- Real-time chat messaging
- Video conferencing signaling
- User presence and status updates
- Typing indicators
- Read receipts

### Connection Flow

1. The client connects to the WebSocket server with authentication token
2. Server verifies the token and attaches user data to the socket
3. User is automatically joined to rooms for their organization, teams, projects
4. User can now send and receive real-time events

### Socket Rooms Structure

- `user:{userId}` - Private room for direct messages to a specific user
- `org:{orgId}` - Room for organization-wide events
- `team:{teamId}` - Room for team events
- `project:{projectId}` - Room for project events
- `chat:{chatRoomId}` - Room for chat messages
- `video:{sessionId}` - Room for video conference events

## Chat Functionality

### Chat Room Types

- Organization chat
- Department chat
- Team chat
- Project chat
- Task chat
- Direct messages
- Group chats

### Chat Features

- Real-time messaging
- Message editing and deletion
- Read receipts
- Typing indicators
- Message reactions (emoji)
- Message threading (replies)
- Pinned messages
- File attachments
- Message search

## Video Conferencing

### Architecture

We use WebRTC for peer-to-peer video and audio streaming, with Socket.IO for signaling.

### Video Features

- Multi-user video calls
- Screen sharing
- Audio mute/unmute
- Video enable/disable
- Chat during call
- Recording
- Participant management
- Call quality indicators

### Conference Flow

1. Host creates a new video conference in a chat room
2. Other participants are notified and can join
3. WebRTC connections are established between participants
4. Media streams (audio/video) are exchanged directly between peers
5. Socket.IO is used for signaling and connection management

## Implementation Notes

- Each organization, department, team, project, and task automatically gets a chat room created
- Video conferences are associated with chat rooms
- All events are persisted in the database for history and offline users
- Redis adapter is used for horizontal scaling of Socket.IO (when enabled)

## Security Considerations

- All WebSocket connections require authentication
- Users only receive events for rooms they have permission to access
- Video streams use DTLS/SRTP encryption (WebRTC standard)
- Session tokens are validated on connection and periodically

## Scaling Considerations

- Socket.IO with Redis adapter enables horizontal scaling across multiple servers
- Database connection pooling for handling increased load
- WebRTC media traffic is peer-to-peer and doesn't go through our servers
- Consider using TURN servers for clients behind strict firewalls or symmetric NATs

## Future Improvements

1. Implement end-to-end encryption for chat messages
2. Add breakout rooms for video conferences
3. Implement selective forwarding unit (SFU) for improved video quality in large meetings
4. Add AI-powered meeting transcription and summarization
5. Implement presence indicators and advanced status messages
6. Add reactions and hand-raising in video conferences
7. Implement virtual backgrounds and video filters
8. Add meeting scheduling functionality integrated with calendar
